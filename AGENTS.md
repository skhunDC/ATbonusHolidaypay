# Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and concise.
- Use clear commit messages and PR titles.
- Run any tests if available.
- Update the README when you add or modify features so new contributors
  understand how to run the Apps Script and HTML interface.
- There are no automated tests. Manual verification in the Apps Script
  editor is expected when making functionality changes.
