# Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and concise.
- Use clear commit messages and PR titles.
- Run any tests if available.
- Update the README when you add or modify features so new contributors
  understand how to run the Apps Script and HTML interface.
- There are no automated tests. Manual verification in the Apps Script
  editor is expected when making functionality changes.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving this project. The Apps Script and HTML files are intentionally small so changes can be reviewed easily. Please keep pull requests focused and concise.

### Getting Started
1. Open `ATT Bonus & Holiday Pay.xlsx` in Google Sheets.
2. Attach the code in `Code.gs` and `index.html` to the spreadsheet.
3. Run the `setup()` function once to create required sheets and triggers.

### Making Changes
- Use clear commit messages and PR titles.
- After editing Apps Script functions, manually verify that they run correctly in the Apps Script editor.
- Update the README if you add or modify user-facing features so others understand how to run the project.

We currently do not have automated tests, so manual validation is important.
