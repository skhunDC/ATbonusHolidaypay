# AT Bonus & Holiday Pay

This repo contains a simple Google Apps Script project and HTML interface used to manage employee bonuses and holiday pay data. The `Code.gs` file holds the backend logic and `index.html` provides a small dashboard for viewing and editing information.

The project does not have any external build steps or test requirements.
